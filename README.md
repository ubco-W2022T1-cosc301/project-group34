# Group 34 - Overfishing and Climate Change


## Milestone 2

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words


One of the major drivers for biodiversity loss in the ocean ecosystem is overfishing. Commercial fishing is a large contributor to exploiting fish stock through unethical methods and practices of catching fish. Unsustainable fishery production continues to weaken the resilience of many marine species to climate change. Thus, making them more vulnerable to ocean warming and extinction. 

The development of technology can be used to implement sustainable fishing practices and mitigate biodiversity loss. Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish and aquatic plants. Farmed fishing has decreased the rate of wild fish catches and increased the resilience of marine species. This allows them to be able to reproduce and sustain population levels. 

We want to explore how overfishing and unsustainable fishery production could impact climate change, and how technologies helped to alleviate some of the pressure on wild fish catch, such as aquaculture, fish and seafood farming.
